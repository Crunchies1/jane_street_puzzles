This was the first puzzle I tried, was linked from Advent of Code.

The image given appeared to be a bunch of cards and games strewn out randomly on a table.

Upon further inspection, the cards and pieces from the games seemed to spell out characters, such as M or O.

A more difficult task was to find how the letters were to be combined in order to get the word. 

After pen and paper-ing for some time, I looked back at the image to see if anything had been missed and looked more closely at the games in the background, which I had assumed were just there to show off all the titles of the games.

I then realised that the layout was quite methodical, why would you have 4 board games on top of each other slightly ajar? It was the ordering of the letters.

From that, I got:

>! MISSINGONES
